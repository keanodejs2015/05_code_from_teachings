## http error Module

This is what we worked on in the last #04 node.js class, but now the errors are moved to a module instead.

The module is called clbo_http_errors and it is placed in the folder node_modules.

Since i also have published the clbo_http_errors to my npm account
The module can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clbo_http_errors) and it can be installed by writing: 

<pre>npm install clbo_http_errors</pre>
