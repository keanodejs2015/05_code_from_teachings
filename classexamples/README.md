## http error Module

This is what we worked with last in the #04 node.js class, but now the errors are moved to a module instead.

The module is called clbo_http_errors and it is placed in the folder node_modules.

Since i also have published the clbo_http_errors to my npm account
The module can be installed by 

<pre>npm install clbo_http_errors</pre>
