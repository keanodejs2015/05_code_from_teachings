## Basic Modules

This is a demo of how to install and use modules.

If you have an empty root folder called class and execute this command in your terminal

<pre>npm install colors</pre>

A folder called node_modules with a folder called colors indside will be created.

<pre>
	class
	  	|
	  node_modules
			|
			colors

</pre>

After this you can use the module by writing

<pre>var colors = require('colors')</pre>

In your app.js file. (or anywhere else in your project)
